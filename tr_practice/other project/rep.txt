percentage is with respect of its parent block element

block element default is 100 psnt 

container containing image generaly width of 90 psnt

the problem with width while using percentage an be solved by setting max width 

em is used in fonts . it is x times the size of its 1st parent 

generaly ems should be avoided because it creates cascading effect 

to counter this we will use rem . it takes refrence from the html element
