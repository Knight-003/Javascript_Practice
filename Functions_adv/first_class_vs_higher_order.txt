first class function is just a concept or a feature which is souported by a programing language and js is one of them 
it simpaly means that function is just a value 

higher order functions are those types of functions which returns or takes another function as an argument or a return value

higher order functions can be written only in language which soports first class because we can pass functions as value

// example
in document.addeventlistner("c",func)
addeventlistner is higher order function and func is callback function
